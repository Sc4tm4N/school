# Minor Tasks

Only selected tasks are included because rest were for example: set up OpenSSL server and setup VPN (OpenSwan), set up Docker with *, attack webservice that is vulnerable for SQLInjecton. 
They are not 'gitable'. There was 9 tasks overall (did all of them, probably one of the most enjoyable programming subject).
